## E-Pharmacy Management System

This mini-project utilizes Python, SQL, and the Streamlit library to create a Pharmacy Database Management System (DBMS) application. 
The application will connect to a MySQL server using the MySQL Connector package in Python, providing a cursor to interact with the database. 
Streamlit will be used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application, and Pandas DataFrame will handle the display of data in a tabular format.
